# Liberty-Mutual-Group-Property-Inspection-Prediction
__Objective__ - The aim is to predict the hazard score based on anonymized variables which are available before an inspection is ordered.

# About the dataset
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a property that was inspected and given a hazard score ("Hazard"). You can think of the hazard score as a continuous number that represents the condition of the property as determined by the inspection. Some inspection hazards are major and contribute more to the total score, while some are minor and contribute less. The total score for a property is the sum of the individual hazards.
